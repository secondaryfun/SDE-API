But none compare to the Crystal Weaver in pure corruption and unfeeling malignance. Once a sacred keeper of the Goddess Chamber, the Crystal Weaver was one of the wonders of Crystalia. That the Midnight Queen was able to taint it in both heart and form is a stain upon the land. Once in the shape of a mighty knight, the golem has taken on the twisted form of one of the Queen's spiders, and stalks the halls of her tower hunting down unfortunate Heroes with unfeeling adeptness.  | Crystal Golem       | Midnight Tower  | Complete

Sometimes, she wishes to pit her own strange and terrible power against the warriors competing to do her honor. Several true assassinations have been attempted during the Tournament, and surely more will come. In truth, this danger is part of what makes these outings so appealing.                                                                                                                                             | Moon Princess       | Kagejima        | Complete

His story might have ended there except that he refused to become bitter. He, instead, focused his anger into overcoming the setbacks his injury initially posed. Honing his senses until he could navigate trails by the sway and sound of his scabbard, identify others by scent, and track any movement by the slightest noise, Mizaru eventually became captain of the Yamazaru’s famed scouts.                                                                                                                       | Mizaru              | Kagejima        | Complete
